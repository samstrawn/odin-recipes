        <h2>Fun and Festive Treat for the Holidays!</h2>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 box red velvet cake mix (or any desired flavor but red velvet looks festive)</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup frosting</li>
            <li>12 ounces candy melts</li>
            <li>lollipop sticks (optional but fun)</li>
            <li>sprinkles or other desired decorative toppings</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350F. Butter a 13x9 in cake pan.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together cake mix, water, oil, and eggs until combined. Pour into pan.</li>
            <li>Bake according to package directions. Cool completely.</li>
            <li>Line a small baking sheet or plate with wax or parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Crumble cooled cake into a large bowl and add frosting. Stir with wooden spoon until texture resembles wet sand.</li>
            <li>Scoop 1 tablespoon of cake mixture and roll into balls.</li>
            <li>Place on lined plate and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or freeze for 30 mins.</li>
            <li>Melt candy according to package instructions and place in a 2 cup measuring cup or tall drinking glass.</li>
            <li>Pull out a few cake balls at a time to work on while the rest stay in the fridge. (keeping them cold helps the coating to set quickly.</li>
            <li>Dip the tip of a lollipop stick in the melted chocolate and insert about halfway into a cake ball</li>
            <li>Dip cake ball into the chocolate, making sure to coat entirely. Remove and let excess chocolate drip off.</li>
            <li>Decorate with sprinkles or toppings (optional) and place upright in a styrofoam block or cardboard box. Let stand until coating is set.</li>
            <p>*Cakepops can last in the fridge up to 1 week!</p>
