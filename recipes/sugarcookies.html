        <li>Add flour, baking powder and salt and beat until combined.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into two equal portions.</li>

        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Line two to four large baking sheets with parchment paper, set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove one sugar cookie dough disc from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 5 minutes to soften slightly.</li>
        <li>Place sugar cookie dough on a floured surface and roll to ½” or ¼” thickness (thicker = softer cookies).</li>
        <li>Use your favorite cookie cutter shapes and cut out the dough and place them 1” apart on the prepared cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>Repeat until all the dough is used.</li>
